### Hey hey, I’m Steve

A software engineer and solutions architect with 25+ years of experience. This profile is for sharing open source work—some new, some older projects I’ve finally decided to publish.  

I’ve been immersed in tech my entire life but never really did the online presence thing. I'm trying to do that now and this is my way of sharing useful tools and ideas with the community.  

I'm currently the Senior Architect at [Copibec](https://www.copibec.ca), formerly at [Scenarex](https://www.scenarex.ca).

Oh and I'm Canadian 🍁, eh?
